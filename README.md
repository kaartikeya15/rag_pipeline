**RAG Pipeline with FastAPI & Mistral AI**

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system from scratch. It ingests PDF documents, extracts and chunks text, embeds those chunks, and enables querying via semantic + keyword search. Responses are generated through Mistral AI LLM, with citations to the supporting document passages.

**Key Features**
	**PDF Ingestion & Chunking**
	•	Upload one or more PDF files via FastAPI.
	•	Text extracted with PyPDF2 and cleaned (whitespace normalization, empty-page skip).
	•	Chunking uses a sliding window with overlap (CHUNK_SIZE and CHUNK_OVERLAP configurable).
	•	Each chunk is tokenized and indexed with:
	•	Semantic embeddings (for similarity search).
	•	Term-frequency maps (for keyword matching).
	**Query Processing**
	•	Lightweight intent detection (e.g., greetings like “hello” don’t trigger retrieval).
	•	Query normalization (lowercasing, whitespace trimming).
	•	Prepared for more advanced query rewriting if extended.
	**Hybrid Semantic Search**
	•	Cosine similarity on embeddings + TF-IDF–style keyword scores combined.
	•	Balances semantic meaning with keyword precision.
	•	No external libraries or vector databases — all retrieval implemented in SQLite + NumPy.
	**Post-processing**
	•	Top-k results merged and re-ranked.
	•	Threshold check: if average similarity is below COSINE_THRESHOLD, system refuses with “Insufficient evidence to answer confidently.”
	•	Results contextualized and passed to the LLM with citations.
	**Answer Generation**
	•	Mistral AI API (mistralai) used for completions.
	•	System prompt enforces grounding: “Answer only using the provided context. Cite sources.”
	•	Answers include inline citations: [doc:page:chunk].
	**Web UI**
	•	Modern chat-style frontend with:
	•	PDF upload
	•	Reset button to clear KB
	•	Smooth chat bubbles (user/right, assistant/left)
	•	Auto-scroll and enter-to-send
	•	Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity.
	**Bonus Features**
	•	No third-party vector DB (embeddings stored in SQLite).
	•	Citations required.
	•	Extendable with:
	•	Answer shaping (e.g., structured tables).
	•	Hallucination filters (check unsupported claims).
	•	Query refusal for PII/legal/medical questions.

📌 Example Usage
	•	Upload:

POST /ingest (multipart/form-data)

Returns ingested docs.

	•	Query:

POST /query
{ "query": "Summarize this document" }

Returns:

{
  "answer": "Revenue grew by 7% ... [doc:file.pdf:p44:366]",
  "sources": ["file.pdf"]
}


	•	Reset KB:

POST /reset

**Design Considerations**
	•	Chunking with overlap: avoids semantic breaks mid-sentence; overlap preserves context continuity.
	•	SQLite instead of vector DB: keeps dependencies light, matches bonus point requirement.
	•	Hybrid retrieval: semantic search handles paraphrasing, keywords catch exact matches.
	•	Threshold refusal: prevents hallucinations by enforcing evidence.
	•	Citations: ensures transparency and trustworthiness.
	•	Extensibility: UI and backend designed to plug in more advanced intent classification, structured answer shaping, and safety policies.
